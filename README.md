- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThomasA92. It's a temporary name ! See it as a placeholder :D
My full name is Thomas ANDY and i live in France . For now i'll just follow a basic structure on my presentation, the default one of Github. I know it's lame but it'll get better with time !

- 👀 I’m interested in learning web development but also coding in general. It's such a wonderful and interesting field that i had tostop myself from going everywhere because everything is so interesting !

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and PHP.Also relearning HTML and CSS for good measures so i'm not inept at getting back into web development.
Later on, i'm interesting in learning React, Angular and Symfony. Also Python and C++. Of course, these last  twos are mostly for fun, but hey, who knwos !

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on TheOdinProject for now and i'll work with some irl friends later on for other projects.

- 📫 How to reach me : Here on my Github.
But you can also get me with my email : thomas.andyfr@gmail.com
